    <p>I watch a lot of anime. I'm keeping up with the new ones for the most part, even if I don't watch them all anymore.
        Currently, the anime I'm most interested in for the season include <i>In the land of Leadale</i>. that is about
        a person who was gravely ill and used a super immersive vr game (one that you can feel and taste in) when the
        power cuts out in the facility that she is being kept alive in and as a result her body dies. However, her mind is
        still in the game. That is just one that I am watching, the one that I could think of off the top of my head... if
        you want to read more about it, you can find more info at

        Oooh boy.... The professor is killing me... I like a lot of music and don't really have one specific artist...
        Well I like a lot of electronic music. one of my favorite artists is <b><span class="fav-music-names">Infected Mushroom</span></b>. If you want to look
        into them, you can go to their <a href="https://infected-mushroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        site</a> or their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/InfectedMushroomVids" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">YouTube
    </a>. I also like a future bass artist called <b><span class="fav-music-names">Snail's House</span></b>. You can find some of their music on their
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYxBY8mhJ7R2rMIcQ28H_Zw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">YouTube
