    <h2 class="heading2-modifier">Current Favorite Anime</h2>

    <p>I watch a lot of anime. I'm keeping up with the new ones for the most part, even if I don't watch them all anymore.
        Currently, the anime I'm most interested in for the season include <i>In the land of Leadale</i>. that is about
        a person who was gravely ill and used a super immersive vr game (one that you can feel and taste in) when the
        power cuts out in the facility that she is being kept alive in and as a result her body dies. However, her mind is
        still in the game. That is just one that I am watching, the one that I could think of off the top of my head... if
        you want to read more about it, you can find more info at

        Well I like a lot of electronic music. one of my favorite artists is <b><span class="fav-music-names">Infected Mushroom</span></b>. If you want to look
